            We all know that learning to speak a new language is a great idea - it keeps our brains healthy and helps us to see the world in new ways. But did you know that learning computer programing languages is also a smart idea? This post will hopefully help you understand a little more about why this is so!

        <p>
            Lots of people immediately think that the main reason to learn how to program a computer is because there are lots of jobs which require that knowledge. Whilst this is one reason to learn programing, I argue that this is less important than many of the other reasons!

            Learning to program is fun because you have to apply knowledge to solving problems. Furthermore, it makes you smarter just like learning other "human" languages makes you smarter. In addition, learning to program helps you see the world differently - the skills you develop whilst programing will impact on how you approach life in general.
        </p>

            Perhaps most importantly, learning to program makes you powerful! It gives you the power to positively change your own life and the lives of others by giving you the ability to creatively solve problems to real world problems!
