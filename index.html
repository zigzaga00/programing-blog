    <h1>Programing Languages</h1>
    <p>
        Being able to program a computer is a fun and useful skill to have. In this post, we will explore some of the most popular languages along with reasons to learn them!

        <h2>All About Languages</h2>
        <p class="strap">
            We all know that learning to speak a new language is a great idea - it keeps our brains healthy and helps us to see the world in new ways. But did you know that learning computer programing languages is also a smart idea? This post will hopefully help you understand a little more about why this is so!
        </p>
        <p>
            Lots of people immediately think that the main reason to learn how to program a computer is because there are lots of jobs which require that knowledge. Whilst this is one reason to learn programing, I argue that this is less important than many of the other reasons!
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning to program is fun because you have to apply knowledge to solving problems. Furthermore, it makes you smarter just like learning other "human" languages makes you smarter. In addition, learning to program helps you see the world differently - the skills you develop whilst programing will impact on how you approach life in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps most importantly, learning to program makes you powerful! It gives you the power to positively change your own life and the lives of others by giving you the ability to creatively solve problems to real world problems!

        <h3>Common Programming Languages</h3>
        <h4><code>Python</code></h4>
        <p>
            <code>Python</code> is a very popular language which was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is relatively easy to learn and is used in lots of different areas ranging from <code>cyber security</code> to <code>big data projects</code> with server side <code>web development</code> found along the way!
        </p>
        <h4><code>Ruby</code></h4>
        <p>
            <code>Ruby</code> is another popular language which was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto and released in 1995. Right from the start, it has been developed with ease of use in mind. <code>Ruby</code> is a stand alone language which can be used for many purposes, but lots of people associate it with <code>Ruby on Rails</code> which is a great <code>web development framework</code> built on <code>Ruby</code>.
        </p>
        <h4><code>C++</code></h4>
        <p>
            <code>C++</code> is another hugely popular language which was built by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension to the <code>C</code> programming language. <code>C++</code> gives developers more control over system resources and memory. It is closely related to <code>C</code>, but <code>C++</code> includes the use of <code>classes</code> and <code>objects</code> since it is an <code>object-oriented</code> programing language.
        </p>
        <h4><code>JavaScript</code></h4>
        <p>
            This is an interesting language since there are different implementations of it. For some time, <code>JavaScript</code> was confined to running only in <code>web browsers</code> - and it still excels as a language to use in <code>front-end web app</code> development - but in 2009 Ryan Dahl developed <code>Node JS</code> which broke <code>JavaScript</code> free and means it can now be used to develop the <code>back-end</code> of <code>websites</code>, too!
        </p>
        <h3>Which One to Learn?</h3>
        <p>
            In many ways it doesn't really matter! Every language is useful and will bring you great benefits. It makes sense to start with one you feel comfortable with and then start to learn additional languages as you go. Just like when learning to speak different languages, once you know one, it is easier to pick up others!
